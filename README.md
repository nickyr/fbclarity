The report is "report.tex" 

The bibliography is "report_references.bib"

Lots of styles in "jpaper.cls" <-- they gave us this file, I've only modified it slightly

To compile:
$ ./latex.sh report

The make file conceivably does the same thing but I didn't notice they gave it to us until I already made my own script.

Thanks!
